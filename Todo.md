### Steps before release:
- [ ] Support images in replier.py (DL/UL)
- [ ] Help module with generated help messages
- [ ] Lock and forbid every keyword used by other plugins (replier.py)
- [ ] Rethink project arborescence
- [ ] Better "dockerization"
- [x] Add docker build and push to master branch CI


### HIGH PRIORITY

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
* SIGTERM/INT support in async ConDeBot class and eventually his launcher
* Do an op level per server
* Learn about unit test in discord.py
* Databases instead of plain (h)json files

### LOW PRIORITY
* Hangman Plugin
* Stalker Plugin (WIP)
* Whois Plugin
* Weather Plugin
* Think about new plugins
* Docs? API? 

### END OF THE BACKLOG
* Check if the bot is really in asyncio mode or I've failed it a bit
