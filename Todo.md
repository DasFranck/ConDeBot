### TOP PRIORITY
* Replacing ugly message metadata tuple by a nice idiomatic class
* Get rid of the Nickdis (Username#Tag) in the whole bot
  * Define ops by User ID and not Username#Tag

### HIGH PRIORITY
* Help module with generated help messages
* Lock and forbid every keyword used by other plugins (replier.py)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
* Do an op level per server
* Learn about unit test in discord.py

### END OF THE BACKLOG
* Check if the bot is really in asyncio mode or I've failed it a bit.
